For each index:
    Set smallest_idx to the current index
    For each index from smallest_idx+1 to the end of the list:
        If the number at the inner index is smaller than the number at the smallest_idx, set smallest_idx to the inner index
    Swap the number at the current index with the number at the smalles_idx
return list
