quick_sort(nums, low, high)
    1. if low is less than high:
        1. partition the input list using partition()
        2. quick_sort() on the left side of the partition
        3. quick_sort() on the right side of the partition

partition(nums, low, high)
    1. set pivot to the element at index high
    2. set i to low
    3. for each index(j) from low to high:
        1. if the element at index j is less than the pivot:
            1. swap the element at index i with the element at index j
            2. increment i by 1
    4. swap the element at index i with the element at index high
    5. return the index i
